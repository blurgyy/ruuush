Given a rectangle with integer side lengths, your task is to cut it into the smallest possible number of squares with integer side lengths.

\InputFile

The first line contains a single integer $T$~--- the number of test cases
($1 \le T \le 3600$).
Each of the next $T$ lines contains two integers $w_i$, $h_i$~---
the dimensions of the rectangle
($1 \le w_i, h_i \le 60$; for any $i \ne j$, either $w_i \ne w_j$ or $h_i \ne h_j$).

\OutputFile

For the $i$-th test case, output $k_i$~--- the minimal number of squares,
such that it is possible to cut the $w_i$ by $h_i$ rectangle into $k_i$ squares.
The following $k_i$ lines should contain three integers each:
$x_{ij}$, $y_{ij}$~--- the coordinates of the bottom-left corner of the $j$-th square
and $l_{ij}$~--- its side length
($0 \le x_{ij} \le w_i - l_{ij}$; $0 \le y_{ij} \le h_i - l_{ij}$).
The bottom-left corner of the rectangle has coordinates $(0, 0)$ and
the top-right corner has coordinates $(w_i, h_i)$.
